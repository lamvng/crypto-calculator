# Cryptographic Calculator

This project is to create a simple application allowing users to perform several cryptographic operations, such as asymmetrical encryption (RSA), asymmetric encryption (DES & AES), hash functions (MD5) and message authentication code (HMAC). 

### Requirements and Installation

[GMP](https://gmplib.org/), [Python 2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-272/) and [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) must be installed before running the program. Then execute the following command from the source code's root directory to build the program:

```
./build_lib.sh
```

Start the program by executing the following commands:

```
python src/implements/interface.py
```

To remove output files created by previous execution, execute the following command:

```
./clean_output.sh
```
